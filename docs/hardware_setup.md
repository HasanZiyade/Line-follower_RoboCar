# Hardware Setup for Robocar Project

## Introduction
This document provides detailed instructions on the hardware setup required for the Robocar project. It includes wiring diagrams, component specifications, and assembly instructions to help you get your Robocar up and running.

## Components Required
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any compatible board.
- **Motors**: Two DC motors for movement.
- **Motor Driver**: L298N or similar motor driver to control the motors.
- **Camera**: USB camera or compatible camera module for image processing.
- **Power Supply**: Battery pack or power adapter suitable for your components.
- **Chassis**: A platform to mount all components.
- **Wires and Connectors**: For making connections between components.

## Wiring Diagram
1. **Connect the Motors**: 
   - Connect the two DC motors to the motor driver outputs.
   - Ensure the motor driver is powered according to its specifications.

2. **Connect the Motor Driver to the Microcontroller**:
   - Connect the input pins of the motor driver to the designated GPIO pins on the microcontroller.
   - Connect the enable pins to PWM-capable pins for speed control.

3. **Connect the Camera**:
   - If using a USB camera, connect it to the USB port of the microcontroller (if supported).
   - For camera modules, follow the specific wiring instructions for your module.

4. **Power Connections**:
   - Connect the power supply to the motor driver and microcontroller.
   - Ensure that the voltage levels are compatible with all components.

## Assembly Instructions
1. **Mount the Components**: Securely attach the microcontroller, motor driver, motors, and camera to the chassis.
2. **Organize Wires**: Use zip ties or clips to keep wires organized and prevent tangling.
3. **Test Connections**: Before powering on, double-check all connections to ensure they are secure and correctly placed.

## Testing the Setup
Once the hardware is assembled, power on the Robocar and run the main application. Monitor the motors and camera to ensure they are functioning correctly. Adjust any connections as necessary.

## Conclusion
Following this guide will help you set up the hardware for the Robocar project. Ensure all components are compatible and securely connected for optimal performance.
